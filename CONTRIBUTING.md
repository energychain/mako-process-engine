# Contributing

Thank you for supporting the MaKo community! This document outlines the preferred workflow for pull requests.

1. **Discuss first** – Open an issue for significant changes so we can align with regulatory updates or internal roadmaps.
2. **Branch naming** – Use `feature/<topic>`, `fix/<ticket>`, or `docs/<topic>`.
3. **Coding standards** – Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` locally. All YAML changes must pass `npm run definitions:validate`.
4. **Documentation** – Update the guides in `docs/` when behaviour or background knowledge changes.
5. **Commit style** – Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep release notes clean.

We welcome contributions in German or English. Please avoid sharing confidential grid or supplier data.
